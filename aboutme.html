    <h2>About Me</h2>
	<div class="bio">
		<h3>Biography</h3>
			<p>My name is Stephany Pena. I grew up in Queens, New York.
			My parents come from Ecuador, making my sister and I Ecuadorian-American.
			I attended Metropolitan Expeditionary Learning School and graduated from there 
			in 2019. My major is Emerging Media Technology at CUNY's City Tech.
			</p>
			<p>I enjoy learning languages and besides English, I know Spanish,
			French, and Japanese. My family's tradition and culture influence me 
			to be curious about other world cultures. They have helped to flourish more 
			interests outside of the generic learning material from the public school 
			system.</p>

		<h3>Professional Goals</h3>
			<p>One of my goals is to continue learning about web design.
			I hope to further understand what makes a consistent web design
			and how to edit any other media outside of web design. I plan to
			become proficient in Photoshop, Illustrator, and other editing 
			programs to gain more resources.</p>
			<p>Programming wise, I would like to continue learning more python,
			C+, and javascript. I hope to add more programming languages to my
			toolkit and better understand in which scenario which programming language is
			better suited for the task at hand in my personal projects. I hope to code
			my own game as I continue learning in my major.</p>
